# 🏕️ ExploreBC

A game for elementary students to learn about the nature of British Columbia, developed within 8 hours during the Western Engineering Competition 2023. In this game, students have 2 minutes to find all emojis that would unlock different facts about BC's nature. Once the game finishes, students can take a quiz to test their understanding.
